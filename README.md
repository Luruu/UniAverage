UniAverage allows you to memorize the university exams passed (and to be passed) and to make estimates.

<b>N.B</b>: In the program it is necessary to enter the dates for passed exams but this information is not currently used for any function. So you might not even necessarily enter a true date.
It is currently recommended to enter passed exams in order manually to see a consistent graph trend.
